Temporal network reachability
=============================

In a temporal network, reachability is a function of time, i.e., the
possiblility of going from node :math:`v_0` at time :math:`t_0` to :math:`v_1`
at :math:`t_1`.

Temporal adjacency

Cluster types
-------------

Clusters are to temporal networks what a component is to a static network. They
store subsets of the temporal network. While sotring a subset of a static
network required only storeing a set of vertices, a subset of a temporal
network also requires temporal information.
