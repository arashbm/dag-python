Reticula is a general purpose C++ library and Python package for fast and
efficient analysis of temporal networks and static and temporal hypergraphs.
Currently, the library supports multiple methods of generating and randomising
networks, using various algorithms to calculate network properties, and running
compartmental model simulations on networks.

The names is the plural form of reticulum, a Latin word meaning network or a
network-like (reticulated) structure.
